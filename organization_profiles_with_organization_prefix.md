- \"The child maltreatment report shows we are making strides in preventing child abuse and neglect. However, the numbers of child maltreatment deaths are higher than they were five years ago, and we need to further understand the underlying circumstances of these fatalities so we can continue to enhance and expand our prevention efforts to keep children safe and well.\" (Jeff Hild, acting assistant secretary for the Administration for Children and Families, 2023)

These quotes demonstrate the Bureau's ongoing commitment to child welfare, its focus on prevention and systemic approaches, and its recent emphasis on addressing racial disparities and encouraging critical analysis of child welfare data.
- **Alignment**: # Organization Assessment: Children's Bureau

### Organization Mission & Activities
- The Children's Bureau is a federal agency focused on improving child welfare and protecting children from abuse and neglect.
- Key activities include administering funding for foster care, adoption, and child abuse prevention programs.
- The bureau also provides guidance on child welfare policies and practices to state and tribal agencies.
- **Evidence & Confidence:** High confidence based on multiple sources describing the bureau's role. The text states it is \"currently part of the Department of Health & Human Services' Administration for Children and Families\" and its mission is to \"improve the lives of children and families through programs that reduce child abuse and neglect, increase the number of adoptions, and strengthen foster care.\"

### Framing of Children's Issues
- The bureau appears to take a systemic approach, focusing on policy, funding, and broad child welfare system improvements.
- There is emphasis on prevention and supporting families, not just individual interventions.
- **Rating:** Medium-High (systemic framing)
- **Evidence & Confidence:** Medium confidence. The text mentions \"promoting the stability and security of Indian tribes and families\" and \"providing grants to states, tribes and communities to operate such services as child protective services, family preservation and support, foster care, adoption, and independent living.\" This suggests a systemic view, but more direct language about root causes would warrant a higher rating.

### Racial Equity & Inclusion
- There is explicit recognition of the need to support Native American communities.
- No clear evidence of broader racial equity focus in the provided text.
- **Rating:** Medium
- **Evidence & Confidence:** Low confidence due to limited information. The mention of Indian Child Welfare Act implementation suggests some focus on equity, but broader racial equity efforts are not evident in the provided text.

### Policy & Systems Influence
- As a federal agency, the Children's Bureau has significant policy influence in child welfare.
- It provides guidance, funding, and oversight that shapes state and tribal child welfare systems.
- **Rating:** High
- **Evidence & Confidence:** High confidence. The bureau's role in administering major federal programs and providing policy guidance is clearly stated in multiple sources.

- It interacts with state and tribal agencies nationwide and influences national child welfare policy.
- **Evidence & Confidence:** High confidence based on its federal agency status and described responsibilities.

### Potential for Alignment & Collaboration
- The Children's Bureau's systemic approach and policy influence align well with the Frameworks Institute's goals.
- As a federal agency, it has the potential to widely disseminate research-backed framing.
- However, bureaucratic constraints may limit flexibility in adopting new frameworks.
- **Evidence & Confidence:** Medium confidence. While the bureau's reach and influence are clear, the text doesn't provide insight into its openness to adopting new framing approaches.

### Barriers & Information Gaps
- Limited information on the bureau's current messaging and framing of child welfare issues beyond broad mission statements.
- Unclear how much autonomy the bureau has to adopt new framing approaches as a federal agency.
- No information on the bureau's current leadership or strategic priorities.

### Summary & Overall Alignment Rating
**Overall Alignment Rating: Medium-High**

The Children's Bureau's federal status, systemic approach to child welfare, and extensive policy influence make it a potentially powerful partner for disseminating the Frameworks Institute's research. Its focus on prevention and family support aligns with a collective responsibility framing. However, bureaucratic constraints and unclear openness to adopting new messaging approaches present potential barriers. More information on the bureau's current framing of issues and strategic priorities would help refine this assessment.

Their size and influence make them a potentially valuable partner if they can be encouraged to adopt more systemic framing approaches.

The organization's global presence and existing policy advocacy work suggest they could be an effective disseminator of the Frameworks Institute's research, though successful collaboration would require addressing internal organizational challenges and supporting a shift in messaging approach.

### Summary & Overall Alignment Rating
**Overall Alignment Rating: Medium-High**

Scholastic represents a potentially valuable partner for the Frameworks Institute given its extensive reach, established credibility, and demonstrated commitment to children's wellbeing through literacy and education. While their current framing could be more explicitly systemic and equity-focused, their infrastructure and influence in the education sector suggest strong potential for effective collaboration. The main uncertainty lies in their appetite for more direct policy advocacy and systemic change messaging.

Key strengths include their vast network of schools, trusted brand, and existing diversity initiatives. Primary areas for development would be strengthening systemic framing and more explicit equity advocacy. Their position as a major educational publisher could make them particularly effective at disseminating new framing approaches through their materials and programs.

Key focus areas include:
1. Defense of public education as cornerstone of democracy
2. Opposition to school privatization efforts
3. Support for racial equity in education funding
4. Advocacy against discriminatory school discipline practices

**Track Record**:
\"When Black males are given access to schools and resources similar to those given to white males, their performance levels improve,\" states a foundation report documenting achievement gaps.

## Approach to Systemic Change

**Systemic Framework**: 
\"Quite frankly, the federal government should really look at a stimulus package that is focused on families in creating loving systems and providing those levels of supports,\" argues John Jackson, highlighting the foundation's systemic approach.

**Racial Equity Stance**: 
\"The story the data tells of 2020 is that when it comes to race, too often in philanthropy, we talk the talk, but we're less likely to finish the race,\" the foundation notes in its #JusticeIsTheFoundation report.

## Current Initiatives

**Major Programs**:
1. Loving Communities Response Fund - Supporting grassroots organizations serving youth and families impacted by school closings and economic hardship
2. #JusticeIsTheFoundation - Data project tracking philanthropic support for racial equity
3. Racial Justice in Education Endowment - $30 million campaign to support racial justice alliances

**Implementation Impact**:
\"Despite a chorus of funders committing to changing their grantmaking practices amid the racial justice protests of 2020, grant dollars awarded to racial equity and racial justice work have declined compared to the period before it,\" the foundation reports, demonstrating its role in tracking and advocating for sustained commitment to equity.

## Network & Partnerships

**Key Collaborations**:
- Alliance for Educational Justice
- Journey for Justice Alliance
- Alliance to Reclaim Our Schools
- Dignity in Schools Campaign

**Geographic Focus**: 
\"Geographically, K-12 racial equity and justice grants are not properly flowing to where students of color are found,\" the foundation notes, with particular attention needed in Southern states where 43% of students of color reside.

## Funding Philosophy

\"We endow museums, universities and hospitals, but we do not endow the infrastructure needed to keep our democracy working and advance racial justice,\" states John Jackson, articulating the foundation's push for sustained investment in racial equity work.

### Alliance for Strong Families and Communities
- **Profile**: # Entity Overview

The Alliance for Strong Families and Communities was a national strategic action network of social sector organizations that operated from 1911-2021, when it merged with the Council on Accreditation to become Social Current. 

Mission: \"To strengthen the capacities and influence of our national network of high-impact nonprofit human serving organizations so that together we may pursue our vision of a healthy society and strong communities for all children, adults, and families.\"

Susan Dreyfus, former CEO, emphasized the organization's broader impact: \"The excellence, distinction and influence of our sector is essential to the promotion of a healthy and equitable society, so all people can reach their full potential and contribute to a strong and vital America.\"

Scope: Represented hundreds of youth and family services agencies nationwide, providing policy advocacy, organizational development, and network coordination for the social services sector.

Evolution: Originally founded as National Association for Societies for Organizing Charity in 1911, underwent several name changes before becoming Alliance for Strong Families and Communities in 2015. Merged with Council on Accreditation in 2021 to form Social Current.

## Policy & Advocacy Work

Major Focus Areas:
- Child welfare system reform
- Family First Prevention Services Act implementation
- Social sector financial sustainability
- Racial equity advancement
- Prevention-based approaches

Advocacy Approach: Combined direct federal policy engagement with network mobilization and capacity building. Maintained Washington D.C. office for federal policy work.

Key Initiative: Played a significant role in shaping the Family First Prevention Services Act. Dreyfus stated: \"Family First puts us on a path to success, but in order to achieve that success, we must act with a careful sense of urgency and work together across sectors with the goal of always putting the well-being of children at the center of what we do.\"

Racial Equity Stance: Made explicit commitments to advancing equity, with dedicated senior leadership (Undraye Howard as Senior Director of Equity, Diversity, Inclusion and Engagement).

Systemic Focus: Emphasized need for fundamental system transformation rather than programmatic tweaks. A report from the organization stated: \"When CBOs are viewed as inefficient pass-throughs, rather than valuable economic entities and contributors to a healthy and productive society, funding tends to be highly restricted in nature.\"

Innovation Emphasis: Polina Makievsky, former Senior Vice President, noted: \"Innovation is no longer optional for social sector organizations. In the face of constant fiscal pressures, growing demand, and a quickening pace of change, we all need to build innovation-ready cultures.\"

Confidence Level: High for organizational structure and policy positions due to multiple consistent sources. Medium for internal operations and impact measurement due to limited public documentation.

Notable Information Gaps:
- Detailed membership data
- Program-specific outcome metrics
- Internal decision-making processes

Their strong corporate partnerships and national presence provide potential leverage points, but success would likely require significant capacity building around policy influence and systemic change strategies.

- Key activities include matching mentors with children, facilitating regular meetings and activities, and providing professional support for these relationships.
- Programs aim to help children reach their full potential, improve academic performance, avoid risky behaviors, and build self-confidence.
- **Evidence & Confidence:** High confidence based on consistent mission statements across multiple sources. For example: \"Our mission is to create and support one-to-one mentoring relationships that ignite the power and promise of youth.\" (BBBS of America website)

### Framing of Children's Issues
- Primarily frames childhood wellbeing through an individual mentorship lens, focusing on one-on-one relationships rather than systemic issues.
- Some recognition of broader factors like poverty and single-parent households, but emphasis remains on individual interventions.
- Limited discussion of policy or structural factors affecting children's wellbeing.
- **Rating:** Low (systemic framing vs. individual)
- **Evidence & Confidence:** Medium confidence. While the organization clearly focuses on individual mentorship, there's limited explicit discussion of how they frame broader childhood issues. Example: \"Youth in the program are: 55% more likely to enroll in college, 81% more likely to report positive goals for the future\" (BBBS Central Oregon)

### Racial Equity & Inclusion
- Some acknowledgment of serving diverse communities and children facing adversity.
- Limited explicit discussion of racial disparities or equity-focused approaches in the provided texts.
- **Rating:** Low to Medium
- **Evidence & Confidence:** Low confidence due to limited information. More details on specific equity initiatives or racial justice framing would be needed for a higher rating.

### Policy & Systems Influence
- Limited evidence of direct policy influence or advocacy in the provided texts.
- Focus appears to be on direct service provision rather than systemic change.
- Some partnerships with schools and community organizations suggest potential for broader influence.
- **Rating:** Low
- **Evidence & Confidence:** Medium confidence. While there's little mention of policy work, the organization's size and partnerships suggest potential for influence if pursued.

### Organizational Reach & Credibility
- Large national organization with over 230 local agencies across the U.S.
- Long-standing history (founded in 1904) and recognized brand.
- Partnerships with schools, businesses, and community organizations.
- Media presence and celebrity endorsements (e.g., Jordin Sparks event at Macy's).
- **Evidence & Confidence:** High confidence based on consistent information across sources about the organization's size and partnerships.

### Potential for Alignment & Collaboration
- Strong focus on youth development aligns with Frameworks Institute's interest in children's wellbeing.
- Extensive network and credibility could be leveraged for dissemination of research.
- Current individual-focused framing may require significant shift to adopt more systemic approach.
- **Evidence & Confidence:** Medium confidence. While the organization's reach is clear, the extent of their openness to reframing their approach is uncertain.

### Barriers & Information Gaps
- Limited information on the organization's stance on systemic issues or policy advocacy.
- Unclear how open leadership might be to adopting more structural framing of children's issues.
- More details needed on any existing equity initiatives or acknowledgment of racial disparities.

### Summary & Overall Alignment Rating
**Overall Alignment Rating: Medium**

Big Brothers Big Sisters has extensive reach and credibility in the youth development space, which could be valuable for disseminating the Frameworks Institute's research. However, their current framing focuses heavily on individual mentorship rather than systemic issues affecting children's wellbeing. While there's potential for collaboration, it would likely require significant effort to shift their messaging and approach toward a more collective, policy-oriented framework. The organization's openness to such a shift is a key uncertainty in this assessment.

- Unknown receptivity to adopting new framing approaches that might challenge current bipartisan positioning

### Summary & Overall Alignment Rating
**Overall Alignment Rating: Medium-High**

The Bipartisan Policy Center offers significant potential as a partner due to its strong policy influence and demonstrated interest in children's issues.

The main challenge would be encouraging stronger equity-focused messaging while maintaining their bipartisan credibility.

The organization's focus on systemic solutions through policy change aligns well with Frameworks Institute's goals, though their framing may need adjustment to more explicitly address structural inequities. Their proven ability to influence policy discussions makes them a potentially powerful partner despite these challenges.

### Center for Curriculum Redesign
- **Profile**: # Entity Overview

The Center for Curriculum Redesign (CCR) is a global non-profit organization focused on improving education systems worldwide. Its core mission is to answer the question: \"What should students learn for the 21st century?\" and to openly propagate its recommendations and frameworks globally.

CCR's operational scope is international, working with jurisdictions, academic institutions, corporations, and non-profit organizations across multiple countries. The organization was founded in 2011 by Charles Fadel, who remains a key figure in its leadership and direction.

The Center's current focus is on developing and promoting a four-dimensional education framework that encompasses knowledge, skills, character, and meta-learning. This framework aims to modernize curricula to better prepare students for the challenges and opportunities of the 21st century.

Confidence: High
Evidence: Multiple sources consistently describe CCR's mission and scope, including the organization's own website and publications.

## Leadership & Structure

Charles Fadel, the founder and chairman of CCR, is the primary decision-maker and public face of the organization. Fadel is described as a global education thought leader, author, and inventor. He is also a visiting scholar at Harvard GSE and chair of the education committee at BIAC/OECD.

The organization's structure appears to be relatively small and focused, with Fadel playing a central role in its operations and advocacy. CCR collaborates with a network of experts and partners rather than maintaining a large internal staff.

Funding sources are not explicitly detailed in the available materials, but the organization's non-profit status suggests a mix of grants, donations, and potentially revenue from publications and consulting work.

Confidence: Medium
Evidence: Information about Fadel's role is consistent across sources, but details on organizational structure and funding are limited.

## Policy & Advocacy Work

CCR's primary policy position is the need for a comprehensive redesign of educational curricula worldwide. The organization advocates for a shift from traditional subject-based learning to a more holistic approach that incorporates skills, character development, and meta-learning alongside knowledge acquisition.

Key policy recommendations include:
1. Modernizing knowledge curricula to include contemporary subjects and interdisciplinary learning
2. Explicitly teaching and assessing skills such as creativity, critical thinking, communication, and collaboration
3. Developing character qualities like mindfulness, curiosity, courage, and ethics
4. Emphasizing meta-learning strategies to help students adapt to changing circumstances

CCR engages with policymakers, education leaders, and international organizations to promote these ideas. The organization has published several books and reports detailing its framework and recommendations, including \"Four-Dimensional Education: The Competencies Learners Need to Succeed\" and \"Artificial Intelligence in Education: Promises and Implications for Teaching and Learning.\"

Confidence: High
Evidence: CCR's policy positions are clearly articulated in its publications and presentations.

## Approach to Systemic Change

CCR advocates for systemic change in education systems globally. The organization views government involvement as crucial for implementing large-scale curriculum reforms. Fadel has stated, \"We need a stable consensus among political factions, and clearly articulated vision of the kind of education students now need.\"

The Center's approach emphasizes collective responsibility for education reform, involving stakeholders from government, academia, and industry. Their framework explicitly addresses issues of equity, proposing that a redesigned curriculum can help address disparities in educational outcomes.

CCR's systemic thinking is evident in its holistic approach to curriculum design, considering not just academic subjects but also the development of skills, character, and meta-learning abilities that are applicable across various life contexts.

Confidence: Medium-High
Evidence: CCR's publications and Fadel's statements consistently emphasize systemic approaches, but specific strategies for implementation at a systemic level are less detailed.

## Network & Influence

CCR has established partnerships and collaborations with various international organizations, including:
- The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)
- United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO)
- World Economic Forum

The organization's primary audience includes education policymakers, curriculum designers, and school leaders. CCR communicates its ideas through publications, conferences, and direct consultations with education systems.

A notable partnership is CCR's work with Whittle School & Studios to develop teaching programs for its international campuses. This collaboration involves implementing CCR's framework to deliver education that is \"truly global, tailored to the individual and fit for the innovation age.\"

Geographically, CCR's influence appears to be global, with mentions of work in countries across North America, Europe, and Asia.

Confidence: Medium-High
Evidence: Partnerships are mentioned in CCR materials and third-party sources, with specific examples like the Whittle School collaboration providing concrete evidence of influence.

## Relevant Initiatives

CCR's primary initiative is the development and promotion of its Four-Dimensional Education framework. This includes:
1. Publishing books and reports detailing the framework and its implementation
2. Conducting research on future skills needs and educational best practices
3. Consulting with education systems on curriculum redesign
4. Organizing and participating in conferences and workshops to disseminate ideas

Specific initiatives include:
- Development of assessment tools for measuring 21st-century competencies
- Research on the impact of artificial intelligence on education, resulting in publications like \"Education for the Age of AI\"
- Creation of the Competencies Compound Inventory for the 21st Century (CCI21), a self-reported scale to assess competencies based on CCR's framework

A notable success is the widespread adoption of the term \"21st century skills\" in educational discourse, which Fadel claims originated from his earlier work.

Confidence: High
Evidence: CCR's publications, website, and third-party sources detail these initiatives and their impact on educational discourse.

## Evidence Base

Quotes demonstrating CCR's approach:

\"We need to redesign curriculum to both broaden and deepen understanding; the current content will need to be re-examined with a fine-toothed comb.\" - Charles Fadel

\"The safest option is to change and not to remain immobile.\" - Charles Fadel, emphasizing the need for systemic change

\"Our framework is a result of the analysis and synthesis of research on learning sciences, views from futurists and economists, standards around the world, and needs of employers and societies -- all organized to be maximally comprehensive, compact, appropriate, and globally relevant.\" - Charles Fadel

Evidence of impact:
\"The term '21st Century Skills' became the moniker used worldwide, but initially people were unclear that it meant the 4C's of Creativity, Critical Thinking, Communication and Collaboration.\" - Charles Fadel, indicating CCR's influence on educational discourse

Research conducted by CCR and partners has resulted in peer-reviewed publications, such as the study on the psychometric properties of the CCI21 scale, demonstrating the organization's commitment to evidence-based approaches.

Confidence: High
Evidence: These quotes are directly attributed to Fadel in interviews and CCR publications, while the research outputs are documented in academic journals.

### Family Justice Initiative
- **Profile**: There is not enough reliable information to create a comprehensive profile of the Family Justice Initiative as requested. The available sources do not contain sufficient details about this specific organization's structure, leadership, policy positions, advocacy work, or initiatives. 

While there are some brief mentions of a \"Family Justice Initiative\" in a few sources, these references are too limited to construct an evidence-based profile meeting the detailed requirements. The mentions lack context about whether they refer to the same organization, and do not provide the depth of information needed across the requested profile sections.

Without access to official materials from the Family Justice Initiative itself or more extensive third-party reporting focused specifically on this organization, it is not possible to responsibly generate the type of thorough, well-evidenced profile requested. Doing so would require making unsupported assumptions or extrapolations beyond what the available information allows.

To create an accurate and useful profile as specified, additional sources with more comprehensive and organization-specific information would be needed. This could include the Family Justice Initiative's own publications, website, or official statements, as well as more detailed external reporting or analysis focused on this particular organization and its work.

### Generations Initiative
- **Profile**: # Insufficient Information for Profile Creation

A reliable profile cannot be created for \"Generations Initiative\" due to lack of clear evidence about a single organization by that exact name.

- Stronger Generations Initiative at Brigham and Women's Hospital focusing on maternal and child health
- Generations Health Care Initiatives in Duluth addressing health equity
- Future Generations Initiative promoting intergenerational collaboration
- Various other generational programs in education, healthcare, and community development

## Requirements for Profile Creation

To create an accurate organizational profile, the following would be needed:
1. Clear identification of the specific organization named \"Generations Initiative\"
2. Verified sources discussing that particular organization's work
3. Documentation of its:
   - Mission and goals
   - Organizational structure
   - Programs and approaches

## Recommendation

The profile creation requires:
1. Confirmation of the exact organization name and location

- **Profile**: # Entity Overview

Help Me Grow is a national initiative that promotes early childhood development through a network of community resources and support systems. The core purpose is to identify developmental concerns in young children and connect families to appropriate services.

**Mission:** To promote optimal child development by enhancing early detection of developmental and behavioral concerns, and linking families to community-based services and supports.

**Operational scope:** Help Me Grow operates as a systems-level model implemented at state and local levels across the United States. It is not a direct service provider, but rather a framework for organizing and leveraging existing resources.

**History and evolution:** Originated in Hartford, Connecticut in 1997 as a pilot project. Expanded statewide in Connecticut by 2002. The national Help Me Grow Center was established in 2010 to support replication of the model across the country.

**Current status:** As of 2023, Help Me Grow is implemented in over 30 states and continues to expand.

## Leadership & Structure

Help Me Grow operates through a national center that supports state and local affiliates. Each affiliate adapts the model to their local context while adhering to core components.

**Organizational structure:** Network model with a national center supporting state and local implementations.

**Resource base:** Funding varies by location. Sources mention support from state agencies, private foundations, and federal grants.

## Approach to Systemic Change

Help Me Grow takes a systems-level approach to improving early childhood outcomes.

**Views on government role:** Sees government as a key partner in implementing early childhood systems. Works closely with state agencies in many locations.

**Position on collective responsibility:** Strongly emphasizes collective responsibility. The Help Me Grow model is based on coordinating across sectors and leveraging existing community resources.

**Evidence of systemic thinking:** The core Help Me Grow model is inherently systemic, focusing on building connections between existing services rather than creating new programs. As stated on the Help Me Grow National Center website: \"Help Me Grow is not a stand-alone program, but rather a system model that utilizes and builds on existing resources in order to develop and enhance a comprehensive approach to early childhood system-building in any given community.\"

## Network & Influence

Help Me Grow operates through extensive partnerships at national, state, and local levels.

**Key partnerships:** Health care providers, early care and education, family support services, government agencies.

**Target audiences:** Families with young children, health care providers, early childhood educators, policymakers.

**Spheres of influence:** Early childhood systems, pediatric primary care, family support services.

**Implementation capability:** Strong. The Help Me Grow National Center provides technical assistance to affiliates for implementation. As stated on their website: \"Successful implementation of the Help Me Grow model requires communities to identify existing resources, think creatively about how to make the most of existing opportunities, and build a coalition to work collaboratively toward a shared agenda.\"

## Evidence Base

Help Me Grow's approach is grounded in the recognition that early intervention is critical for optimal child development. The Help Me Grow National Center website states: \"Help Me Grow is a system of supports for pregnant women, caregivers with new babies, and families with young children with developmental delays and disabilities.\"

The organization's systemic approach is evident in their focus on connecting existing resources. As described on the Help Me Grow Washington website: \"Help Me Grow strengthens the grid by maintaining a current directory of available services and connecting service providers to each other to create an interconnected system.\"

### Homegrown
- **Profile**: # Homegrown

Unfortunately, there is insufficient consistent information available to create a comprehensive profile for a single \"Homegrown\" entity as requested. The sources provided contain fragmented details about various organizations and initiatives using the name \"Homegrown,\" but no cohesive information about one specific entity matching the requested profile structure.

The sources mention:

- A Seattle-based restaurant chain called Homegrown
- A community garden program called Homegrown by Phipps 
- A Michigan cannabis company named Homegrown
- A \"Homegrown By Heroes\" initiative for farmer veterans
- Various local events or initiatives using the \"Homegrown\" name

However, none of these provide enough depth or consistency to construct the detailed organizational profile requested, particularly regarding policy positions, systemic change approaches, and leadership structures.

To create an accurate and evidence-based profile, additional sources would be needed that focus on a specific Homegrown organization. These should include official documentation, leadership statements, policy papers, and third-party analyses of their work and impact. Without such targeted information, any attempt to construct the requested profile would require significant speculation and potentially lead to inaccurate conclusions.

Given the current limitations of the available information, it is not possible to responsibly create the comprehensive organizational profile as instructed.
- **Alignment**: # Organization Assessment: Homegrown

### Organization Mission & Activities
- Multiple \"Homegrown\" initiatives appear in the texts, but focusing on the most relevant program: Phipps' Homegrown program is dedicated to increasing community access to fresh produce, promoting better food choices, and improving overall health of families and children.

- No explicit discussion of racial equity or disparities in the provided text
- Shows commitment to accessibility through free resources and programs
- **Rating:** Medium
- **Evidence & Confidence:** Medium confidence - while program serves diverse communities, racial equity is not explicitly centered in available materials.

### Policy & Systems Influence
- Limited evidence of direct policy influence
- Focuses on direct service provision and education
- Member of Pittsburgh Food Policy Council suggests some policy engagement
- **Rating:** Low
- **Evidence & Confidence:** Medium confidence - while some policy connections exist, primary focus appears to be direct service.

### Organizational Reach & Credibility

### Juvenile Detention Alternatives Initiative
- **Profile**: # Entity Overview

The Juvenile Detention Alternatives Initiative (JDAI) is a nationwide reform effort launched in 1992 by the Annie E. Casey Foundation. JDAI's core purpose is to demonstrate that jurisdictions can safely reduce reliance on juvenile detention while maintaining public safety and improving youth outcomes.

JDAI operates in over 300 counties across 40 states and the District of Columbia, reaching approximately 30% of the U.S. youth population. The initiative has expanded significantly since its inception with five pilot sites in the 1990s.

JDAI's mission is to promote changes to policies, practices, and programs to:
- Reduce unnecessary and inappropriate detention of youth
- Reduce racial and ethnic disparities 
- Improve public safety
- Save taxpayer dollars
- Stimulate overall juvenile justice reforms

## Leadership & Structure

JDAI is led and funded by the Annie E. Casey Foundation, a private philanthropy focused on improving outcomes for children and families. The initiative is overseen by the foundation's Juvenile Justice Strategy Group.

Key decision-makers:
- Nate Balis, Director of the Juvenile Justice Strategy Group at Annie E. Casey Foundation
- Previously led by Bart Lubow, former director of JDAI

JDAI operates through a network of state and local sites that implement the model. Each site typically has:
- A steering committee of key stakeholders
- A JDAI coordinator 
- Working groups focused on specific strategies

Funding comes primarily from the Annie E. Casey Foundation, with additional support from state and local governments in some jurisdictions.

## Policy & Advocacy Work

JDAI advocates for policy changes at state and local levels to reduce reliance on juvenile detention. Key policy positions include:

1. Limiting the use of secure detention to only those youth who pose a serious risk to public safety
2. Expanding community-based alternatives to detention
3. Reducing racial and ethnic disparities in the juvenile justice system
4. Improving conditions of confinement in detention facilities

JDAI's approach involves data-driven decision making, stakeholder collaboration, and system-wide reform. The initiative has a strong track record of impact, with participating sites reporting significant reductions in detention populations.

## Approach to Systemic Change

JDAI takes a decidedly systemic approach to juvenile justice reform:

Government role: JDAI works closely with government agencies, viewing them as key partners in reform efforts. The initiative seeks to change how government systems operate rather than working around them.

Collective responsibility: JDAI emphasizes collaboration among multiple stakeholders, including courts, probation, law enforcement, schools, and community organizations.

Racial equity: Reducing racial and ethnic disparities is a core goal of JDAI. The initiative explicitly addresses systemic racism in the juvenile justice system. For example, Black youth were detained at six times the rate of white youth nationwide.

Systemic thinking: JDAI's model involves reforming multiple aspects of the juvenile justice system simultaneously, recognizing the interconnected nature of different parts of the system.

## Network & Influence

JDAI has an extensive network of partners and influences:

Key partnerships:
- State and local government agencies
- Juvenile courts and probation departments
- Law enforcement agencies
- Community-based organizations
- Schools

Target audiences: 
- Juvenile justice system practitioners
- Policymakers at state and local levels
- Community leaders

Communication channels:
- National conferences
- Training and technical assistance
- Publications and reports

Spheres of influence: JDAI has significant influence in the juvenile justice field, shaping practices and policies across the country.

Geographic reach: National, with sites in 40 states and the District of Columbia

## Relevant Initiatives

JDAI's work revolves around eight core strategies:

1. Collaboration between juvenile justice agencies and community organizations
2. Use of accurate data to inform decision-making
3. Objective admissions criteria and instruments to guide detention decisions
4. Alternatives to detention
5. Case processing reforms
6. Special detention cases (e.g., probation violations)
7. Reducing racial disparities
8. Improving conditions of confinement

Notable successes:
- 50% reduction in average daily detention population across JDAI sites
- 63% reduction in commitments to state custody in JDAI sites
- Tens of millions of dollars in annual cost savings

Specific examples of successful implementations:
- Lucas County, Ohio: Implemented an Opportunity-Based Probation model with rewards and incentives for youth to achieve case plan goals
- Marion County, Indiana: Reduced juvenile detention admissions by 66.4% and average daily population by 40.8% between 2006 and 2016

Examples of alternatives to detention programs:
- Electronic monitoring
- Day and evening reporting centers
- Home confinement
- Shelter care

## Evidence Base

Policy positions:
\"JDAI provides a framework of strategies that help reduce the inappropriate use of secure juvenile detention, while maintaining public safety and court appearance rates.\"

Approach to change:
\"JDAI is a process, not a conventional program, which means JDAI helps restructure policy and practice to create system improvements that reach far beyond detention alone.\"

Network connections:
\"JDAI sites have demonstrated safe reductions in the number of youth detained through a set of interrelated strategies which include: Collaboration among juvenile court officials, probation agencies, prosecutors, defense attorneys, schools, community organizations and advocates\"

Implementation ability:
\"Since launching their JDAI efforts, across the initiative sites have reduced admissions to secure detention by 57 percent and average daily population by 50 percent, and they have done so while protecting public safety.\"

Impact achievement:
\"Across these sites, an average of just 3.7% of youth were discharged from a detention alternative program as the result of a new delinquency charge.\"

Recent data shows that JDAI sites have continued to make progress in reducing juvenile detention populations, with some jurisdictions reporting reductions of up to 70% compared to pre-JDAI levels.

### Kansas Action for Children
- **Profile**: # Entity Overview

Kansas Action for Children (KAC) is a nonprofit advocacy organization based in Topeka, Kansas. Founded in 1979 by the Junior League of Topeka, Junior League of Wichita, Junior League of Johnson & Wyandotte Counties, and the Kansas Children's Service League, KAC has grown from a small coalition into one of the leading child advocacy organizations in the country. Its core mission is to shape health, education, and economic policy to improve the lives of the approximately 700,000 children who call Kansas home.

Over four decades, KAC has expanded its focus from solely child welfare to encompass broader policy areas impacting children's wellbeing. The organization engages in bipartisan advocacy, partnerships, and information-sharing on key issues affecting children across the state.

**Confidence level:** High
**Evidence:** Multiple sources consistently describe KAC's mission, history, and founding organizations.
**Gaps:** Detailed information about the organization's early years is limited.

## Leadership & Structure

John Wilson serves as the President and CEO of Kansas Action for Children. Other key staff members include Adrienne Olejnik (Vice President) and Emily Fetsch (Director of Policy and Research).

KAC operates with a relatively small staff, but leverages partnerships and coalitions to extend its reach and impact. The organization is funded through a combination of individual donations and private foundation support.

Decision-making appears to be centralized within the leadership team, with input from policy experts and researchers on staff.

**Confidence level:** Medium
**Evidence:** Leadership information is consistent across sources, but detailed organizational structure is not fully clear.
**Gaps:** Specific information about board structure, exact staff size, and detailed funding sources is limited.

## Policy & Advocacy Work

KAC focuses on three main policy areas:
1. Early learning and education
2. Health (including Medicaid expansion and child health insurance)
3. Economic security for families

The organization engages in a range of advocacy approaches, including:
- Direct lobbying of state legislators
- Public education campaigns
- Policy research and analysis
- Coalition-building with partner organizations

KAC has a strong track record of legislative engagement, regularly testifying before committees and providing policy briefs to lawmakers. They have achieved notable successes, such as preserving funding for early childhood programs and advancing child care subsidy policies.

A key initiative is their annual KIDS COUNT data book for Kansas, which tracks critical indicators of child well-being. This data informs their policy positions, such as their push for Medicaid expansion and the creation of a state-level child tax credit.

**Confidence level:** High
**Evidence:** Multiple sources, including news articles and KAC's own reports, detail their policy work and advocacy efforts.
**Gaps:** Detailed metrics on long-term policy impact are not always available.

## Approach to Systemic Change

KAC demonstrates a clear commitment to systemic solutions rather than individual-focused approaches. They consistently advocate for policy changes and government interventions to address child welfare issues.

On collective responsibility, John Wilson, KAC's president, stated: \"We have to wrestle with the tension of long-held beliefs. We shouldn't be … punishing kids as a result of not supporting people that care for kids.\" This indicates a strong stance on collective societal responsibility for child welfare.

KAC explicitly addresses racial equity in their work. For example, they emphasize the need to \"ensure success for kids from communities of color who face barriers created by historic policy choices.\"

Adrienne Olejnik, Vice President at KAC, highlighted the interconnected nature of their work: \"We start to see households become more financially insecure, or not being able to put food on the table for every meal. It's more likely that children will start to experience high levels of absenteeism and adverse childhood experiences, and it gets into this wicked cycle that then affects their ability to learn.\"

**Confidence level:** High
**Evidence:** Numerous statements from KAC leadership and policy positions demonstrate their systemic approach.
**Gaps:** Detailed information on how racial equity is operationalized in all aspects of their work is not fully clear.

## Network & Influence

KAC is well-connected within the child advocacy space in Kansas and nationally. They are the Kansas member of the KIDS COUNT network, a national and state-by-state effort to track the status of children in the United States.

Key partnerships include:
- Annie E. Casey Foundation
- Kansas Children's Cabinet and Trust Fund
- Child Care Aware of Kansas
- Kansas State Department of Education

KAC's primary audiences include state legislators, policymakers, and other child-focused organizations. They communicate through policy briefs, reports, social media, and direct engagement with lawmakers.

Their influence appears to be strongest at the state level, particularly within the Kansas legislature and state agencies dealing with children's issues. For example, KAC played a crucial role in preserving the Children's Initiatives Fund, which supports early childhood programs in Kansas, despite attempts to divert this funding.

**Confidence level:** Medium-High
**Evidence:** Partnerships and coalition memberships are mentioned across multiple sources. Policy wins demonstrate their influence.
**Gaps:** The full extent of KAC's informal networks and behind-the-scenes influence is not fully clear from public sources.

## Relevant Initiatives and Impact

Current programs and projects include:
- Annual KIDS COUNT data book for Kansas
- Advocacy for Medicaid expansion
- Push for creation of a state-level child tax credit
- Efforts to improve child care subsidy policies
- Tracking and addressing child poverty and food insecurity rates

KAC has demonstrated strong implementation capability, particularly in terms of policy analysis and advocacy. They regularly produce in-depth reports and data analyses to support their policy positions.

The organization's impact is evident in both policy wins and their role in shaping public discourse on children's issues. Following a legislative victory against tax cuts that would have primarily benefited wealthy Kansans, Wilson stated: \"Today, senators did the right thing by putting balanced state revenues ahead of tax cuts that would mostly benefit the wealthiest Kansans.\"

KAC's work on early childhood issues has also gained traction. Regarding a new early childhood task force, Wilson said: \"The best policies and proposals are those that have been shaped by diverse stakeholders, which is why I am excited for the work of this task force.\"

**Confidence level:** High
**Evidence:** KAC's website, news articles, and statements from leadership provide detailed information on their initiatives and successes.
**Gaps:** Comprehensive evaluation data on the long-term impact of specific initiatives is not always available.

### LIFT
- **Profile**: # Entity Overview

This profile cannot be created as initially requested due to a fundamental misunderstanding in the original analysis. The sources provided information about multiple distinct organizations that share \"LIFT\" in their names but are otherwise unrelated:

1. ORCA LIFT - A transit card program
2. Project LIFT - A disaster recovery nonprofit
3. Another LIFT organization referenced in a quote from Dominga

These entities should not be combined into a single profile as they appear to be separate organizations with different missions, structures, and operational areas.

## Recommendation

To accurately represent the information provided, separate profiles should be created for each distinct LIFT entity:

1. ORCA LIFT Transit Program
2. Project LIFT (Disaster Recovery Nonprofit)
3. LIFT (Social Services Organization, if sufficient information is available)

Each profile should clearly state its specific focus and avoid conflating information from the other organizations. Additionally, any profile created should only include information that can be directly attributed to that specific organization based on the provided sources.

## Information Gaps

Significant information gaps exist for each of these organizations. More research is needed to:

- Confirm the full names and missions of each organization
- Understand their individual organizational structures
- Identify leadership beyond Project LIFT
- Determine geographic scope and primary areas of operation
- Clarify funding sources and financial information
- Understand core programs and services offered by each
- Identify any potential relationships or partnerships between these organizations, if any exist

Without additional sources providing clear, organization-specific information, creating comprehensive profiles for any of these LIFT entities would be challenging and potentially misleading.
- **Alignment**: # Organization Assessment: LIFT

### Organization Mission & Activities
- LIFT appears to be a nonprofit organization focused on supporting at-risk teens, young adults, and families.
- Key activities include providing education support, job training, and temporary housing assistance.
- Their mission implicitly touches on children's wellbeing through family support and youth programs.
- **Evidence & Confidence:** High confidence based on multiple references to LIFT's work with teens, young adults, and families. Example: \"Project LIFT is a transformative nonprofit organization seeking to assist at-risk teens and young adults work on their mental health.\"

### Framing of Children's Issues
- LIFT seems to frame issues with a mix of individual support and community-level intervention.
- There's emphasis on personal transformation and skill-building, but also recognition of broader community needs.
- **Rating:** Medium
- **Evidence & Confidence:** Medium confidence. The text shows individual support (\"work on their mental health\") alongside community-level responses (\"built tiny houses for people whose homes were damaged\"). More information on how they frame root causes would be helpful.

### Racial Equity & Inclusion
- No explicit mentions of racial equity or disparities in the provided text.
- The organization appears to serve diverse communities, but specific equity-focused approaches are not highlighted.
- **Rating:** Low
- **Evidence & Confidence:** Low confidence due to lack of information. This is a significant information gap.

### Policy & Systems Influence
- Limited evidence of direct policy influence or systemic advocacy.
- LIFT seems focused on direct service provision and community-level interventions.
- **Rating:** Low
- **Evidence & Confidence:** Medium confidence. While the text doesn't mention policy work, it does show community-level impact through housing initiatives. More information on any advocacy efforts would be beneficial.

### Organizational Reach & Credibility
- LIFT appears to have significant local impact and partnerships with other nonprofits.
- They have the capacity to undertake substantial projects (e.g., building tiny houses).
- Media coverage suggests some level of public recognition.
- **Evidence & Confidence:** Medium confidence. The organization's ability to mobilize resources and gain media attention indicates credibility, but the scale of their reach is unclear.

### Potential for Alignment & Collaboration
- LIFT shows potential for alignment through their community-focused work and recognition of broader social issues.
- Their hands-on approach to youth development could be a strong platform for implementing systemic framing.
- **Evidence & Confidence:** Medium confidence. While their current framing isn't fully aligned, their mission and activities suggest openness to adopting more systemic approaches.

### Barriers & Information Gaps
- Lack of information on LIFT's stance on racial equity and systemic causes of poverty.
- Unclear whether LIFT engages in policy advocacy or public education campaigns.
- More details needed on their theoretical framework for understanding childhood wellbeing.

### Summary & Overall Alignment Rating
- **Overall Alignment Rating: Medium**
- LIFT demonstrates strong community engagement and a holistic approach to supporting youth and families, which aligns with the Frameworks Institute's goals. However, their current framing appears more focused on individual transformation than systemic change, and there's limited evidence of policy influence or explicit equity focus. With proper resources and guidance, LIFT could potentially pivot to incorporate more systemic framing in their work, leveraging their direct service experience to inform broader narratives about childhood wellbeing.

Their recent DEI initiatives show some movement toward equity considerations, but implementation has been controversial. The organization's infrastructure could potentially support dissemination of Framework Institute's research, but significant shifts in framing and approach would likely be needed. Their focus on private education may also limit their effectiveness in promoting broader systemic change.

### National Center for Literacy Education
- **Profile**: # National Center for Literacy Education

### Profile Limitations

A comprehensive profile of the National Center for Literacy Education (NCLE) cannot be created based on the provided source materials. While various literacy initiatives, centers, and education programs are mentioned, none provide clear evidence about NCLE as a specific entity with its own organizational structure, leadership, or programs.

### Related Organizations Mentioned in Sources

The sources discuss several literacy-focused organizations and initiatives, including:

- The National Center on Improving Literacy (NCIL), which partners with literacy experts, state and local agencies, teachers, and families to help students with literacy-related disabilities, including dyslexia.
- Various state literacy centers
- University-based literacy programs, such as the Maryann Manning Family Literacy Center at the University of Alabama at Birmingham
- The National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), which provides data on literacy rates and educational outcomes

### Additional Information Needed

To create an accurate profile of NCLE, additional sources would be needed that specifically discuss:

- NCLE's organizational structure and history
- Its leadership and decision-making processes
- Specific programs and initiatives
- Policy positions and advocacy work
- Partnerships and network connections

### Possible Explanations for Lack of Information

The absence of information about NCLE as a distinct entity in these comprehensive sources about literacy education suggests several possibilities:

1. The organization may no longer be active
2. It may have merged with or been replaced by other literacy organizations
3. It may operate under a different name
4. The provided sources don't capture its work

A thorough profile would require additional research focused specifically on NCLE's organizational documentation, public records, and direct program materials.

However, their current public framing appears more focused on individual interventions than broader societal responsibility. The organization's established credibility and reach in NYC could be valuable for disseminating new framing approaches, but more information is needed on their openness to adopting a more explicitly systemic and equity-focused framework.

### Next Generation
- **Profile**: After reviewing all available source materials, I cannot create a reliable profile for an organization called \"Next Generation\" that works on children's welfare and wellbeing. None of the provided texts contain information about a specific organization by that name or its activities related to children's welfare.

The sources discuss various \"next generation\" concepts, including:

• NextGen donor network for UNICEF
• Next generation of news readers in Slovenia
• Next generation technology and AI education
• Next generation combat aircraft
• Next generation dance students
• Next generation of musicians and artists

However, these references do not pertain to a single organization focused on children's welfare and collective caregiving. Without primary source material about the specific organization \"Next Generation\" and its work, creating an evidence-based profile would require speculation and could lead to inaccurate conclusions.

To create a proper profile, we would need verified information such as:

• Official organizational documents
• Program descriptions and reports
• Leadership statements and communications
• Policy positions and advocacy materials
• Partnership and network information
• Impact evaluations and assessments

Without access to such specific, credible information about \"Next Generation\" as an organization, it is not possible to construct an accurate profile of its structure, mission, leadership, or activities related to children's wellbeing.
- **Alignment**: # Organization Assessment: Next Generation

### Organization Mission & Activities
- Next Generation appears to be a network or program focused on supporting UNICEF's work for children's rights and wellbeing.
- They engage donors in fundraising, advocacy, and learning opportunities to expand children's potential.
- **Evidence & Confidence:** \"NextGen donors amplify their impact by leading fundraising efforts, advocating for the protection of children's rights, applying to a NextGen Board and engaging in learning opportunities to expand every child's opportunity to reach their full potential.\" (High confidence in this characterization based on direct statement)

### Framing of Children's Issues
- The organization seems to frame children's issues as a collective responsibility, emphasizing advocacy and systemic change.
- They mention \"protecting children's rights\" which suggests a broader, rights-based approach.
- **Rating:** Medium (leaning towards systemic framing, but limited information)
- **Evidence & Confidence:** The focus on advocacy and rights suggests a systemic approach, but there's limited detail on how they frame specific issues. (Medium confidence)

### Racial Equity & Inclusion
- There is no explicit mention of racial equity or inclusion in the provided text.
- **Rating:** Low (based on lack of evidence)
- **Evidence & Confidence:** No direct evidence found. This is a significant information gap. (Low confidence due to lack of information)

### Policy & Systems Influence
- The organization mentions advocacy for children's rights, suggesting some level of policy engagement.
- They have a NextGen Board, which could indicate a structure for influencing decisions.
- **Rating:** Medium
- **Evidence & Confidence:** \"advocating for the protection of children's rights\" suggests policy influence, but details on specific campaigns or policy wins are lacking. (Medium confidence)

### Organizational Reach & Credibility
- Next Generation is associated with UNICEF, a highly credible international organization.
- They have a donor network and a board structure, suggesting some organizational capacity.
- **Evidence & Confidence:** The UNICEF association and mention of a donor network indicate reach and credibility. (High confidence in UNICEF association, medium confidence in overall reach due to limited details)

### Potential for Alignment & Collaboration
- The focus on children's rights and advocacy aligns well with the Frameworks Institute's goals.
- Their engagement in learning opportunities suggests openness to new approaches.
- **Evidence & Confidence:** \"engaging in learning opportunities to expand every child's opportunity\" indicates potential receptiveness to new framing strategies. (Medium confidence due to limited information)

### Barriers & Information Gaps
- Lack of specific information on how they frame children's issues in detail.
- No clear indication of their stance on racial equity or inclusion.
- Limited information on the scale of their operations or specific policy influence.
- Unclear how much autonomy they have from UNICEF in messaging and strategy.

### Summary & Overall Alignment Rating
**Overall Alignment Rating: Medium**

Next Generation shows potential as a partner for the Frameworks Institute due to their focus on children's rights, advocacy work, and association with UNICEF. Their emphasis on collective action and systemic change aligns with the desired framing. However, the lack of explicit equity focus and limited details on their specific framing approaches and policy influence temper this assessment. More information on their independent messaging strategies and openness to adopting new framing approaches would be beneficial for a more definitive evaluation.

### North Dakota Association for the Education of Young Children
- **Profile**: The North Dakota Association for the Education of Young Children (NDAEYC) was formed at an organizational meeting on May 1, 1976 in Mayville, North Dakota, and was officially certified as an affiliate of the National Association for the Education of Young Children in March 1977. David Wright, Assistant Professor of Early Childhood Education at Mayville State College, and Maurice Lucas, Associate Professor of Early Childhood Education at the University of North Dakota, were instrumental in forming the organization.

According to the organization's constitution, its purpose is \"to serve and act on behalf of the needs, rights, and education of all young children.\" The association works toward these goals by:

- Advocating for legislation beneficial to young children, such as establishing government funding for kindergartens in North Dakota schools
- Conducting workshops and conferences on issues related to child care, development, and needs
- Organizing events like the Week of the Young Child to raise awareness of children's needs

Beyond these basic historical and mission-related facts, there is insufficient information in the source materials to make additional substantive claims about NDAEYC's current structure, specific policy positions, advocacy work, initiatives, network, or impact. A more comprehensive profile would require additional sources such as the organization's current website, official documents, press releases, or interviews with leadership.

- They express a desire to \"meet different people from different walks of life, all with their own stories to tell,\" which suggests an inclusive approach.
- **Rating:** Medium
- **Evidence & Confidence:** Medium confidence. Inclusion is a clear theme, but racial equity is not explicitly addressed in the provided text.

### Policy & Systems Influence
- There is no clear evidence of policy influence or systemic advocacy in the provided information.
- The organization seems focused on direct community engagement rather than policy-level work.
- **Rating:** Low
- **Evidence & Confidence:** Medium confidence. While the text doesn't mention policy work, it's possible this information is simply not included in the provided excerpt.

### Potential for Alignment & Collaboration
- The organization's focus on inclusivity and community connection aligns well with collective framing of social issues.
- Their interest in shared reading experiences could potentially be expanded to include more systemic understanding of factors affecting reading access and community wellbeing.
- Their community-based approach might make them receptive to incorporating research-based framing strategies.
- **Evidence & Confidence:** Medium confidence. While their values seem aligned, it's unclear how open they would be to adopting new framing approaches.

- No clear indication of their approach to policy or systemic change.
- Unclear whether they have experience incorporating research into their practices.
- More information needed on their specific activities and any existing partnerships.

### Summary & Overall Alignment Rating
**Overall Alignment Rating: Medium**

Shared Story's focus on inclusive, community-based reading experiences aligns well with collective framing of social issues. However, their apparent lack of policy influence and unclear organizational reach may limit their ability to broadly disseminate the Frameworks Institute's research. The organization shows potential for adopting systemic framing, but more information is needed on their capacity and openness to incorporating new approaches.

- **Rating:** Medium (leaning towards systemic framing)
- **Evidence & Confidence:** The text cites CDC statistics on youth mental illness and emphasizes the need for \"effective mental health interventions and resources.\" Medium confidence due to limited information.

### Racial Equity & Inclusion
- There is no explicit mention of racial disparities or equity-focused approaches in the provided text.
- **Rating:** Low
- **Evidence & Confidence:** High confidence in the absence of equity-specific language, but this could be due to the limited scope of the text rather than the organization's overall approach.

- The text suggests some level of policy engagement, mentioning \"advocating for better mental health policies and resources.\"
- They appear to work with mental health experts and potentially influence public discourse on mental health issues.
- **Rating:** Medium

### Organizational Reach & Credibility

- They appear to engage with national-level data and initiatives.
- **Evidence & Confidence:** Medium confidence. The organization's ability to convene experts suggests some level of credibility, but specific details about their reach or partnerships are limited.

### Potential for Alignment & Collaboration
- SparkAction's focus on mental health action and systemic change aligns well with the Frameworks Institute's goals.
- Their emphasis on moving from awareness to action suggests openness to new, evidence-based approaches.
- **Evidence & Confidence:** Medium confidence. The alignment in framing mental health as a collective issue is promising, but more information on their specific programs and openness to collaboration would be helpful.

### Barriers & Information Gaps
- The text provides limited information about SparkAction's specific programs, organizational structure, or past achievements.
- It's unclear how much of their work focuses specifically on children versus broader mental health issues.
- More information on their approach to racial equity and specific policy initiatives would be beneficial.

### Summary & Overall Alignment Rating
- **Overall Alignment Rating: Medium**
- SparkAction shows potential as a partner due to their focus on systemic mental health action and apparent ability to convene experts and influence discourse. Their framing of mental health as a collective issue aligns with the Frameworks Institute's approach. However, the lack of explicit equity focus and limited information on specific programs and policy influence tempers this assessment. More information on their organizational capacity and openness to adopting new framing strategies would be needed to fully evaluate their potential as a partner.

### Summary & Overall Alignment Rating
**Overall Alignment Rating: High**

The Duke Endowment demonstrates strong potential as a partner for the Frameworks Institute due to its significant resources, systemic understanding of social issues, explicit commitment to racial equity, and track record of scaling evidence-based solutions. While geographically focused, their influence within the Carolinas and reputation in the philanthropic sector could make them an effective partner for promoting collective responsibility frameworks.

The organization operates through four guiding principles applied across all programming, taking a strengths-based approach to create impact through:
- Public education
- Narrative change 
- Technical advisement
- Civic engagement
- Capacity building
- Leadership development
- Peer mentorship
- Well-being support
- Policy reform

## Leadership & Structure
Founder/CEO: Ebony Underwood
- Social entrepreneur
- Content creator
- Advocate
- ASPEN Institute Ascend Fellow
- Personal experience as daughter of incarcerated parent who served 33 years

\"This experience can be extremely lonely, which is why we are now with our bullhorns saying this is a completely forgotten population of children affected by parental incarceration, without many outlets to share our own stories and to be in community with one another,\" explains Ashley Jackson, Director of Operations.

The organization maintains a network of \"Actionists\" across the country - individuals with direct experience of parental incarceration who serve as public speakers and advocates.

## Policy & Advocacy Work
Legislative Achievements:
- Successfully passed five pieces of legislation at local, state and federal levels
- Provided technical assistance to Congressional representatives including former Rep. Karen Bass and Senator Cory Booker on Second Look legislation

Key Policy Positions:
\"For decades children have been separated from their parents due to harsh and cruel policies of incarceration. The Families Act stops this cycle in its tracks with a solution that not only ensures the well-being of the parent through sentencing alternatives, but ensures that the children of the parent are also provided with necessary supports in the process.\"

Additional advocacy priorities include:
- Support for free phone and video calls for incarcerated parents
- Opposition to mail digitization policies that limit physical mail between parents and children
- \"Social media has been an avenue for so many young people in my community to be able to advocate for our parents,\" notes Underwood regarding opposition to social media restrictions

## Approach to Systemic Change
The organization explicitly focuses on systemic solutions while acknowledging individual impacts:

\"WE GOT US NOW believes that society must stop incarcerating our way out of problems and understand that children need their parents and some parents need a little more support than others. The Families Act is a legislative effort that acts as a turnkey solution to keeping families connected, creating fair sentencing, and empowering families and communities.\"

Strong emphasis on racial equity, highlighting data showing Black children are 7.5 times more likely than white children to have an incarcerated parent.

## Network & Influence
Partnerships and Engagement:
- Regular White House engagement
- Academic institutions including Yale Law School, Notre Dame, UC Berkeley
- The Just Trust
- Criminal justice reform organizations
- Federal agencies
- State corrections departments

Geographic Reach: National presence with particular strength in federal advocacy and multi-state programming through 25 Actionists across 14 states.

### Western Center
- **Profile**: # Entity Overview
From the available sources, there appear to be multiple distinct \"Western Centers.\" Without additional context to identify which specific Western Center is the focus, I cannot create an accurate profile that would be useful for mapping the children's welfare ecosystem.

The sources describe:

### Western State School and Hospital/Western Center (Pennsylvania)
- State-run mental hospital and reform school, closed in 2000
- Originally established in 1850 as House of Refuge of Western Pennsylvania
- Served youth under 21 and individuals with intellectual disabilities
- Final closure involved relocating 380 residents to community-based facilities

### Highland Community College Western Center (Kansas)
- Technical education center in Baileyville, KS
- Offers six technical programs including Construction, Diesel Technology, Welding
- Provides Allied Health courses and general education classes
- Serves traditional and non-traditional students, including high school students

### Western Center Academy (California)
- STEM-focused charter school
- Offers honors, Advanced Placement, and dual-enrollment courses
- Structured admissions process with lottery system
- Serves middle and high school students

### National Western Center (Colorado)
- Development project in Denver
- Includes community investment fund providing grants to local organizations
- Focuses on neighborhood improvement and community benefit
- Generated $86,000 in initial community grants in 2024

To create a meaningful profile for assessing potential partnership in children's welfare research, we would need to:
1. Identify which specific Western Center is relevant
2. Obtain sources focused on that particular organization
3. Gather information specifically related to their work with children and families

Creating a profile without this clarity would risk conflating different organizations and producing misleading analysis. The sources provided do not contain sufficient information about any single Western Center's approach to children's welfare, systemic change, or collective responsibility that would support meaningful ecosystem mapping.
- **Alignment**: # Organization Assessment: Western Center

### Organization Mission & Activities
- Western Center appears to be a former state-run mental hospital and reform school located near Canonsburg, Pennsylvania.
- It primarily served individuals with intellectual disabilities and youth in need of reform.
- The facility closed in 2000, with residents relocated to community-based settings.
- **Evidence & Confidence:** High confidence based on clear historical information provided. However, this assessment is based on a defunct institution, not an active organization.

### Framing of Children's Issues
- The text does not provide information on how the organization framed children's issues.
- As a state-run institution, it likely focused on individual treatment rather than systemic causes.
- **Rating:** Low (based on limited information and nature of the institution)
- **Evidence & Confidence:** Low confidence due to lack of specific information on framing.

### Racial Equity & Inclusion
- No information is provided about racial equity considerations or inclusive practices.
- **Rating:** Low (based on lack of information)
- **Evidence & Confidence:** Low confidence due to absence of relevant information.

### Policy & Systems Influence
- The center was involved in legal actions related to disability rights, which led to policy changes in resident care.
- The closure of the center was part of a broader shift towards community-based care for individuals with disabilities.
- **Rating:** Medium
- **Evidence & Confidence:** Medium confidence based on mentions of legal actions and policy shifts, but limited details on specific advocacy efforts.

### Organizational Reach & Credibility
- Western Center was a significant institution in its community, even featured in local tours and festivals.
- It gained some notoriety, being used as a filming location for popular movies.
- **Evidence & Confidence:** Medium confidence based on mentions of community prominence, but limited information on broader influence or networks.

### Potential for Alignment & Collaboration
- As a closed institution, there is no potential for direct collaboration.
- The history of Western Center could potentially inform current discussions about institutional care vs. community-based support for children and individuals with disabilities.
- **Evidence & Confidence:** High confidence that direct collaboration is not possible. Low confidence in potential for historical lessons due to limited information on current relevance.

### Barriers & Information Gaps
- The organization no longer exists, creating a fundamental barrier to collaboration.
- No information is provided on any successor organizations or ongoing initiatives related to Western Center's former work.
- Details on the center's approach to children's wellbeing, educational philosophy, or community engagement practices are missing.

### Summary & Overall Alignment Rating
- **Overall Alignment Rating: Low**
- Western Center, as a now-closed state institution, does not align with the Frameworks Institute's goals for partnership. While its history involved care for children and individuals with disabilities, there's no evidence of systemic framing or ongoing influence that could support disseminating research on children's wellbeing. The closure of the center and shift to community-based care might offer historical context for current policy discussions, but direct collaboration is not possible.

Their position within Yale provides substantial credibility and reach, while their integrated research-practice model suggests strong capacity for implementing and disseminating new framing approaches. The main uncertainty lies in their specific capacity for public communication and advocacy, but their institutional infrastructure and commitment to evidence-based practice suggest they could effectively incorporate the Frameworks Institute's research into their work.

Key uncertainties include their appetite for policy advocacy and ability to shift organizational messaging toward more systemic framing.
